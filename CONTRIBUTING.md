# Contributing

This is a practical guidance for contributions to this repository. Give the repository a star ⭐, it really helps!

## Mindset

When you start a conversation, you don't have to be **welcoming** (e.g. Hello), or mention authors (e.g. @FrameMuse) every time.
We all understand our assignement here and don't get upset if we don't get "hello".

When people reply you with _neutral_ sounding text, it may sound rude - while **it's not**, please, don't take it personal.

Be proffesional, tactical and straighforward. If you want to relax and get chills with authors and some other contributors,
you can visit our [Dicord Server](https://discord.gg/sHp2pxrSws).

## Taking over Issues

1. Choose what you think you're confident in
2. Make you sure you understand the scope of the work, you can do it via a single comment, letting maintainers know what you're willing to change and how you approach it
3. Get approval and Assigement to the issue
4. Make a fork (and branch optionally)
5. Start working
6. Open a Pull Request

## Pull Request

- PR should have a summary if you feel like it needs explanation (you don't need to force yourself to write it, keep it as short as possible)
- Commits should follow ["conventional commits"](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Code style should be similar to what it is currently written in
- Follow the spec, create tests and documentation if you're not so lazy 😊
- Get PR approval
- If there was some time after approval, kindly ask to merge

If you have any questions or would like to consult, don't be shy to text maintainers in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sHp2pxrSws), via email or [open discussions](https://github.com/pinely-international/tama/discussions).
Try to not open **unrelated** conversations in issues just to contact maintainers (if there are other ways to).
